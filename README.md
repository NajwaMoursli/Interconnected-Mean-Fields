## Interconnected-Mean-Fields

Research project made with **The UNIC-CNRS (http://cns.iaf.cnrs-gif.fr/) research team inspired by the Virtual Brain Approach (https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/)** during my MEng internship at **Polytech-Sorbonne**

## Project Outiline
Unlike in vivo and in vitro experimental setups, in silico models offer the possibility of studying a wide range of neuronal and stimulation parameters and might help to interpret experimental results.

Therefore, inspired by the Virtual Brain approach ({https://www.thevirtualbrain.org), the examination of scaling up possibility will be assessed with a two interconnected columns model which could help ascertaining the bifurcation brain states map for a better understanding of the interactions of time-varying parameters with the dynamics of large neural populations.

* **sim_files_ipynb** : Jupyter notebook in order to produce the simulation (can chnage the parameters and configuration)
  * **interconn_sim_b1.ipynb** : main file to get the mean firing rate map and the time traces for each (Qe,delay) values to draw bifurcation states
  * **Adex_interconn.ipynb** : interconnected corresponding AdEx
* **image_b1_rk4**: times traces and heatmap obtained through the simulation :
