## Interconnected-Mean-Fields

Research project made with **The UNIC-CNRS (http://cns.iaf.cnrs-gif.fr/) research team inspired by the Virtual Brain Approach (https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/)

## Repositories
* **MF repositories** : include the transfer function, single_cells and synapases constructions as displayed :

* **sim_files_ipynb** : Jupyter notebook in order to produce the simulation (can chnage the parameters and configuration)
  * **interconn_sim_b1.ipynb** : main file to get the mean firing rate map and the time traces for each (Qe,delay) values to draw bifurcation states
* images obtained through the simulation
